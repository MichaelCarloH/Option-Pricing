Characteristic Function
=======================

The characteristic function is a mathematical tool used in the analysis of financial instruments, particularly in the context of option pricing. It is an essential concept in the Fourier transform methods, which are often used to compute option prices under more complex models, such as models with stochastic volatility or jump-diffusion processes.

Definition
----------
The characteristic function of a random variable :math:`X` is defined as the expected value of the exponential function of the variable multiplied by an imaginary number :math:`i`:

.. math::

   \varphi_X(t) = \mathbb{E}\left[e^{itX}\right]

Where:
- :math:`t` is a real number.
- :math:`\mathbb{E}` denotes the expected value.
- :math:`i` is the imaginary unit.

In finance, the characteristic function of the log of asset prices is particularly important, especially when using the Fourier transform to price options.

Application in Option Pricing
-----------------------------
In option pricing, the characteristic function can be used in conjunction with numerical methods, such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), to efficiently compute option prices under complex models.

For example, in models with jumps (e.g., the Merton jump-diffusion model), the characteristic function helps us describe the distribution of asset prices over time and is used to compute option prices through the inverse Fourier transform.

Fourier Transform Option Pricing
---------------------------------
Fourier transform methods, using the characteristic function, are valuable for pricing options when closed-form solutions are difficult to derive. The key advantage is that they can handle complex, non-normal distributions, such as those seen in markets with jumps or stochastic volatility.

The option price can be computed by taking the inverse Fourier transform of the characteristic function. This method is computationally efficient and has gained popularity in the quantitative finance industry.
