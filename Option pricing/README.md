# Option Pricing Folders

This repository contains code for pricing options using two popular models: the **Black-Scholes Model** and the **Heston Model**. Individual README are available with graphs and results for each folder.
## Folder: Black-Scholes Pricing

The **Black-Scholes Pricing** folder contains the necessary code to calculate the price of European options using the Black-Scholes model. The Black-Scholes model is a well-known mathematical model that provides a theoretical estimate of the price of options.

## Folder: Heston_pricing

The **Heston_pricing** folder contains code for pricing options using the **Heston Model**, which accounts for **stochastic volatility**. Unlike the Black-Scholes model, the Heston model assumes that volatility follows a mean-reverting process, providing a more accurate representation of real market behavior, especially for assets with volatile price movements. This folder includes implementation of the Heston model using numerical methods.
