# Quantitative Finance Models

This project contains three main notebooks to implement quantitative finance models and option pricing techniques.

## Notebooks:

1. **`black_scholes_calibration.ipynb`**:
   - This Jupyter notebook calibrates the Black-Scholes model to find the optimal volatility.

2. **`exotic_montecarlo_pricing.ipynb`**:
   - This notebook implements exotic option pricing using Monte Carlo simulations.
   - It focuses on pricing Asian and Barrier options.

3. **`implied_vol_surface.ipynb`**:
   - This Jupyter notebook calculates and visualizes the implied volatility surface.
   - It estimates implied volatilities based on market data.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Necessary libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `ipython`, etc.

## Setup:
To get started, make sure all dependencies are installed. You can install the necessary Python packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
